# CakePHP Application Skeleton

A skeleton for creating applications with [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org) 3.x.

The framework source code can be found here: [cakephp/cakephp](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp).

## Installation

1. Download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) or update `composer self-update`.
2. Run `php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app [app_name]`.

If Composer is installed globally, run

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app
```

In case you want to use a custom app dir name (e.g. `/myapp/`):

```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist cakephp/app myapp
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.

## Update

Since this skeleton is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit `config/app.php` and setup the `'Datasources'` and any other
configuration relevant for your application.

## Layout

The app skeleton uses a subset of [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) CSS
framework by default. You can, however, replace it with any other library or
custom styles.

## Project
You are given a 3-D Matrix in which each block contains 0 initially. The first block is defined by the coordinate (1,1,1) and the last block is defined by the coordinate (N,N,N). There are two types of queries.

UPDATE x y z W
updates the value of block (x,y,z) to W.

QUERY x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2
calculates the sum of the value of blocks whose x coordinate is between x1 and x2 (inclusive), y coordinate between y1 and y2 (inclusive) and z coordinate between z1 and z2 (inclusive).

Input Format
The first line contains an integer T, the number of test-cases. T testcases follow.
For each test case, the first line will contain two integers N and M separated by a single space.
N defines the N * N * N matrix.
M defines the number of operations.
The next M lines will contain either
